# In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data type that allow you to store and organize data in key-value pairs. Objects are used to represent complex entities or structures and are a cornerstone of the language, enabling you to model real-world concepts in your code. Objects can contain properties and methods, making them versatile and powerful for various programming tasks.

Here's an overview of how objects work in JavaScript:

**Creating Objects:**
Objects can be created using object literals or the `Object` constructor:

1. **Object Literal:**

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 30,
  isStudent: false,
};
```

2. **Object Constructor:**

```javascript
const person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 30;
person.isStudent = false;
```

**Accessing Properties:**
Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation:

```javascript
console.log(person.firstName); // "John"
console.log(person["age"]);    // 30
```

**Modifying and Adding Properties:**
You can modify existing properties or add new properties to an object:

```javascript
person.age = 31;            // Modifying existing property
person.city = "New York";   // Adding a new property
```

**Nested Objects:**
Objects can contain other objects as properties, creating a nested structure:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
  },
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    state: "NY",
  },
};
```

**Methods:**
Objects can also contain methods, which are functions assigned to properties:

```javascript
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};
console.log(person.fullName()); // "John Doe"
```

**Iterating Over Properties:**
You can loop through an object's properties using `for...in` loop:

```javascript
for (const key in person) {
  console.log(key, person[key]);
}
```

**Object Keys and Values:**
You can retrieve an array of object keys or values using `Object.keys()` and `Object.values()`:

```javascript
const keys = Object.keys(person);     // ["firstName", "lastName", ...]
const values = Object.values(person); // ["John", "Doe", ...]
```

# Objects are a core concept in JavaScript and are widely used for representing structured data, modeling real-world entities, and creating more complex data structures. Understanding how to work with objects effectively is crucial for building dynamic and flexible applications.

# These methods are available on any object, including objects created using object literals, constructor functions, or built-in constructors like `Array`, `Date`, and `RegExp`. Here's a list of some of the most commonly used methods:

**1. `Object.keys(obj)`**: Returns an array of the enumerable property names of an object.

**2. `Object.values(obj)`**: Returns an array of the enumerable property values of an object.

**3. `Object.entries(obj)`**: Returns an array of arrays, where each inner array contains a key-value pair from the object.

**4. `Object.assign(target, ...sources)`**: Copies the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

**5. `Object.hasOwnProperty(prop)`**: Returns `true` if the object has the specified property directly on itself (not in its prototype chain).

**6. `Object.is(obj1, obj2)`**: Determines whether two values are the same value.

**7. `Object.freeze(obj)`**: Freezes an object, preventing new properties from being added and existing properties from being removed or modified.

**8. `Object.seal(obj)`**: Seals an object, preventing new properties from being added and making all existing properties non-configurable.

**9. `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)`**: Returns the prototype (internal `[[Prototype]]` property) of the specified object.

**10. `Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, prototype)`**: Sets the prototype of an object.

**11. `Object.entries(obj)`**: Returns an array of arrays, where each inner array contains a key-value pair from the object.

**12. `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)`**: Returns an array of all property names (including non-enumerable properties) of an object.

**13. `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors(obj)`**: Returns an object containing all own property descriptors of an object.

**14. `Object.keys(obj)`**: Returns an array of the names of an object's own enumerable string properties.

**15. `Object.values(obj)`**: Returns an array of an object's own enumerable property values.

**16. `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty(prop)`**: Returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property as its own property.

These methods provide various ways to interact with and manipulate objects in JavaScript. Keep in mind that some of these methods are available on the `Object` constructor itself, while others are available on object instances or prototypes. Understanding these methods will enhance your ability to work with objects effectively in your code.
