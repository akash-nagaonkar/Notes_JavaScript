# In JavaScript, memory management is an essential concept that involves how data is stored, accessed, and released during the execution of your program. JavaScript uses two main types of memory allocation: the stack and the heap.

**Stack:**
The stack is a region of memory used for managing function calls and local variables. It operates in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the stack, which contains information about the function's arguments, local variables, and the location to return to after the function finishes execution. As functions complete, their frames are popped off the stack.

Stack memory is typically used for:

- Storing primitive data types like numbers and booleans.
- Storing function call information, including the return address.

The stack memory is limited in size, and exceeding its capacity can lead to a stack overflow error. Recursive functions that don't have a base case can cause this error.

**Heap:**
The heap is another region of memory used for storing complex data structures and objects. Unlike the stack, the heap is more flexible in terms of memory allocation and deallocation. Objects and data on the heap can be accessed non-sequentially, making it suitable for storing larger and dynamically allocated data.

Heap memory is used for:

- Storing objects, arrays, and other complex data structures.
- Dynamic memory allocation for objects whose size can't be determined at compile time.

Garbage collection is a process that automatically frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer needed. JavaScript engines use various garbage collection algorithms to identify and release unused memory from the heap.

For instance, consider this simple JavaScript code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

var message = greet("Alice");
console.log(message);
```

In this example, when the `greet` function is called, a new frame is created on the stack to hold the function's local variables and arguments. Once the function completes, the frame is popped off the stack. The `message` variable is stored in memory on the heap, as its value is not determined until runtime.

In summary, stack and heap memory are two distinct regions of memory used for different purposes in JavaScript. The stack is used for managing function calls and local variables, while the heap is used for storing objects and dynamically allocated data. Understanding memory management is crucial for writing efficient and reliable JavaScript code.
