## Memoization ##

Memoization is an optimization technique used in computer programming, including JavaScript, to improve the performance of functions by caching their results. The purpose of memoization is to avoid redundant calculations by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

In JavaScript, memoization is particularly useful for functions that are computationally intensive and are called with the same arguments multiple times. By saving the results of function calls in a cache (usually an object), you can eliminate the need to recompute the result when the same inputs are encountered again.

Here's a basic example of implementing memoization in JavaScript:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n in memo) {
    return memo[n];
  }

  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  }

  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Returns the 10th Fibonacci number
```

In this example, the `fibonacci` function uses memoization to calculate Fibonacci numbers more efficiently. The `memo` object serves as a cache, storing the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers. If a result for a particular value of `n` is already in the cache, the function returns that cached result instead of recomputing it.

Benefits of Memoization:

1. **Performance Improvement:** Memoization can significantly speed up the execution of functions that are called with the same inputs repeatedly, reducing redundant computations.
2. **Complex Algorithms:** Memoization is useful for complex algorithms that involve recursive calculations or expensive computations.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Many dynamic programming problems can be efficiently solved using memoization.

It's important to note that memoization is most effective when used with functions that have the property of "pure" functions, meaning their output is solely determined by their inputs, and they have no side effects. Additionally, memoization can consume memory, as cached results are stored. Therefore, it's essential to use it judiciously and consider cases where the cache might grow too large.

If you're working with JavaScript, libraries like Lodash provide utility functions for memoization.
